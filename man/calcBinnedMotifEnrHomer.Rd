\usage{
calcBinnedMotifEnrHomer(
  gr,
  b,
  genomedir,
  outdir,
  motifFile,
  homerfile = findHomer(),
  regionsize = "given",
  Ncpu = 2L,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{gr}{A \code{GRanges} object (or an object that can be coerced to one)
with the genomic regions to analyze.}

\item{b}{A vector of the same length as \code{gr} that groups its elements
into bins (typically a factor, such as the one returned by \code{\link{bin}}).}

\item{genomedir}{Directory containing sequence files in Fasta format (one per chromosome).}

\item{outdir}{A path specifying the folder into which the output files will be written.}

\item{motifFile}{A file with HOMER formatted PWMs to be used in the enrichment analysis.}

\item{homerfile}{Path and file name of the \code{findMotifsGenome.pl} HOMER script.}

\item{regionsize}{The peak size to use in HOMER (\code{"given"} keeps the coordinate
region, an integer value will keep only that many bases in the region center).}

\item{Ncpu}{Number of parallel threads that HOMER can use.}

\item{verbose}{A logical scalar. If \code{TRUE}, print progress messages.}
}
\value{
A \code{SummarizedExperiment} object with motifs in rows and bins
  in columns, containing six assays: \itemize{
  \item{p}{: -log10 P values}
  \item{FDR}{: -log10 false discovery rates}
  \item{enr}{: motif enrichments as Pearson residuals}
  \item{log2enr}{: motif enrichments as log2 ratios}
  \item{sumForegroundWgtWithHits}{: Sum of foreground sequence weights
    in a bin that have motif hits}
  \item{sumBackgroundWgtWithHits}{: Sum of background sequence weights
    in a bin that have motif hits}
}
}
\description{
Run complete HOMER motif enrichment analysis, consisting of
    calls to \code{\link{prepareHomer}}, \code{\link[base]{system2}} and
    \code{\link{parseHomerOutput}}.
}
\seealso{
The functions that are wrapped: \code{\link{prepareHomer}},
    \code{\link[base]{system2}} and \code{\link{parseHomerOutput}},
    \code{\link{bin}} for binning of regions
