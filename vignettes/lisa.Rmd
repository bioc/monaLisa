# Introduction

`lisa` makes use of her father [Homer](http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/index.html)
to look for enriched motifs in sets of genomic regions, compared to all other regions.

The motifs come from a collection of transcription factor binding site specificities,
such as `JASPAR2018`.

The regions could be for example promoters, non-promoters (distal regions) or accessible regions.

The regions are grouped into bins according to a numerical value assigned to each
bin, such as change of expression or accessibility.

`lisa` can also be used to look for motifs in sequences.

Finally, `lisa` can can be used to predict what transcription factors are likely to explain observed changes in chromatin accessibility between two conditions.



# Quick example: Identify enriched motifs

```{r, quick, eval=FALSE}
# load package
library(lisa)

# bin regions
# (atac.peaks.change is a numberical vector)
bins <- bin(x = atac.peaks.change, binmode = "equalN", nElement = 400)

# dump motifs into file
dumpJaspar("jaspar2018.motif", pkg = "JASPAR2018")

# find Homer (findMotifsGenome.pl)
homerfile <- findHomer(dirs = "/path/to/look/into")

# run analysis
# (atac.peaks is a GRanges)
resL <- runHomer(gr = atac.peaks, b = bins, genomedir = "/work/gbioinfo/DB/genomes/mm10",
                 outdir = "myresults", motifFile = "jaspar2018.motif", homerfile = homerfile,
                 regionsize = "given", Ncpu = 4L)

```

`resL` is a list with components *p*, *FDR*, *enr* and *log2enr*, each containing a matrix
with motifs (rows) by bins (columns). The values are:  

- *p*: the raw P value ($-\log_{10} p$) of a given motif enrichment in a given bin,
  as reported by Homer. Each P value results from a Homer analysis testing each
  motif occuring within the bin, compared to its occurrences in all other bins
  as a background.  
- *FDR*: Same as *p* but adjusted for multiple testing using the method of
  Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 (`p.adjust(..., method="fdr"`).  
- *enr*: Motif enrichments, calculated as: $enr = (o - e) / \sqrt e$, where $o$ and
  $e$ are the observed and expected numbers of regions in the bin containing a
  given motif. These enrichments correspond to $z$ values ($z = (z - \mu)/\sigma$),
  assuming that the numbers of regions in a bin that contain a motif are independent
  Poisson random variables with mean and variance $e$.
- *log2enr*: Motif enrichments, calculated as: $log2enr = log2((o + 8)/(e + 8))$,
  where $o$ and $e$ are the observed and expected numbers of regions in the bin
  containing a given motif.


# Detailed example: Finding TFs enriched in differentially methylated regions

The detailed example is based on an in vitro differentiation system, in which
mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells are differentiated into neuronal progenitors (NP).
In an earlier study [@LMRs], we have analyzed the genome-wide CpG methylation patterns
in these cell types and identified so call *low methylated regions* (LMRs), that
have reduced methylation levels and correspond to regions bound by transcription
factors.

We have later published a tool that systematically identifies such regions from
genome-wide methylation data [@MethylSeekR]. Interestingly, a change in methylation
of LMRs is indicative of altered transcription factor binding. We will therefore
use these regions to identify TF motifs that are enriched/depleted in LMR regions
that change their methylation between ES and NP cell states.


## Load library
We start by loading the needed libraries:  
```{r loadlib, message=FALSE}
library(GenomicRanges)
library(lisa)
```

## Genomic regions of interest
`lisa` contains a file with genomic coordinates (mouse mm9 assembly) of LMRs,
with the respective changes of methylation:  
```{r loadLMRs}
lmrfile <- system.file("extdata", "LMRsESNPmerged.gr.rds", package = "lisa")
lmr <- readRDS(lmrfile)
lmr
```

You can see there are `r length(lmr)` LMRs, most of which gain methylation between
ES and NP stages:  
```{r deltameth}
hist(lmr$deltaMeth, 100, col = "gray", main = "",
     xlab = "Change of methylation (NP - ES)", ylab = "Number of LMRs")
```

In order to keep the computation time reasonable, we'll select 10,000 of the LMRs randomly:  
```{r lmrsel}
set.seed(1)
lmrsel <- lmr[ sample(x = length(lmr), size = 10000, replace = FALSE) ]
```


## Bin genomic regions
Now let's bin our LMRs by how much they change methylation, using the `bin` function.
We are not interested in small changes of methylation, say less than 0.3, so we'll
use the `minAbsX` argument to create a *no-change* bin in [-0.3, 0.3). The remaining
LMRs are put into bins of 800 each:  
```{r binlmrs}
bins <- bin(x = lmrsel$deltaMeth, binmode = "equalN", nElement = 800, minAbsX = 0.3)
table(bins)
```

Because of the asymmetry of methylation changes, there is only a single bin with LMRs
that lost methylation and many that gained:  
```{r plotbins}
plotBinDensity(lmrsel$deltaMeth, bins, legend = "topleft")
```

Note that the bin-breaks around the *no-change* bin are not exactly -0.3 to 0.3.
They have been adjusted to have the required 800 LMRs per bin.

## Prepare motif enrichment analysis
Next we prepare the Homer-based motif enrichment analysis. We first need to create
a file with the motifs that we are interested in. A simple way is to dump the vertebrate
motifs from the `JASPAR2018` package into a file:  
```{r dumpjaspar}
motiffile <- tempfile(fileext = ".motif")
dumpJaspar(motiffile, pkg = "JASPAR2018", relScoreCutoff = 0.9)
```

Next we need to know where Homer is installed (you may have to adjust the `dirs`
argument below according to your environment):  
```{r homerscript}
homerfile <- findHomer(dirs = "/work/gbioinfo/Appz/Homer/Homer-4.8/bin/")
```

## Run motif enrichment analysis
Finally, we run the analysis. Again, you may have to adjust the `genomedir`.

This step may take a while, for this reason you do not need to run it, but can just load the results as shown below:  
```{r runhomer, eval=FALSE}
outdir <- tempfile(fileext = ".output")
resL <- runHomer(gr = lmrsel, b = bins, genomedir = "/work/gbioinfo/DB/genomes/mm9",
                 outdir = outdir, motifFile = motiffile, homerfile = homerfile,
                 regionsize = "given", Ncpu = 20L)
```

<!--
saveRDS(resL, "/work/gbioinfo/stadler/development/R/compbio-lisa/inst/extdata/resL.rds")
-->

In case you did not run the above code, let's now read in the results:  
```{r gethomerresults}
resL <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "resL.rds", package = "lisa"))
```

We can plot the results using the `plotMotifHeatmaps` function, e.g. selecting all factors that have an absolute log2 enrichment of at least 1.0 in any bin:  
```{r plottfs}
# select strongly enriched TFs
sel <- apply(resL[["log2enr"]], 1, function(x) max(abs(x))) > 1.0
sum(sel)
resLsel <- lapply(resL, function(x) x[sel,])
# shorten names
resLsel <- lapply(resLsel, function(x) { rownames(x) <- sub("\\|.*$","",rownames(x)); x })
# plot
plotMotifHeatmaps(x = resLsel, b = bins, which.plots = c("log2enr","FDR"), width = 2.0,
                  cluster = TRUE, maxEnr = 2, maxSig = 10)
```


# Use `lisa` to annotate genomic regions with predicted motifs

As mentioned `lisa` can also be used to scan sequences for motifs. Here is an
example (just on few sequences/motifs for illustration):

```{r findMotifs}
# get sequences of promoters as a DNAStringSet
# (could also be a single DNAString, or the name of a fasta file)
library(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene)
gr <- promoters(TxDb.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19.knownGene, upstream = 1000, downstream = 500)[c(1,4,5,10)]
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19)
seqs <- getSeq(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19, gr)
seqs

# get motifs as a PWMatrixList
# (could also be a single PWMatrix, or the name of a motif file)
library(JASPAR2018)
library(TFBSTools)
pwms <- getMatrixSet(JASPAR2018, list(matrixtype="PWM", tax_group="vertebrates"))
pwms <- pwms[c("MA0885.1","MA0099.3","MA0033.2","MA0037.3","MA0158.1")]
pwms

# predict hits in sequences
res <- findMotifHits(query = pwms, subject = seqs, min.score = 6.0, method = "matchPWM")
res

# ... or using method = "homer2"
homerfile <- findHomer(homerfile = "homer2", dirs = "/work/gbioinfo/Appz/Homer/Homer-4.8/bin/")
res2 <- findMotifHits(query = pwms, subject = seqs, min.score = 6.0, method = "homer2", homerfile = homerfile)
res2

summary(res %in% res2)

# create hit matrix:
# number of site of each motif per sequence
m <- table(seqnames(res), as.character(res$pwmname))
m
```

<!--
REMARK: findMotifHits(..., method="homer2") seems to differ from matchPWM:
- homer2 needs base probabilities rather than log2-odds
- homer2 uses natural logarithm rather than log2

potential solution for method="homer2":
- convert PWM into pseudo-PWM with base probabilities (see pwms4 below)
- convert min.score to natural log to run homer2
- convert homer2 reported scores back to log2 scale

# create pseudo-pwm for homer2 (probabilities instead of log2-odd scores)
pfms3 <- getMatrixSet(JASPAR2018, list(matrixtype="PFM", tax_group="vertebrates"))
pfms3 <- pfms3[c("MA0885.1","MA0099.3","MA0033.2","MA0037.3","MA0158.1")]
pwms3 <- do.call(PWMatrixList, lapply(pfms3, function(x) { y <- toPWM(x); Matrix(y) <- sweep(Matrix(x), 2, colSums(Matrix(x)), "/"); y }))

# create pseudo-pwm for homer2 converting from log2-odds score pwm
pwms4 <- do.call(PWMatrixList, lapply(pwms, function(x) { y <- (2^Matrix(x) / bg(x)); Matrix(x) <- sweep(y, 2, colSums(y), "/"); x }))

homerfile <- findHomer(homerfile = "homer2", dirs = "/work/gbioinfo/Appz/Homer/Homer-4.8/bin/")
matchPWM(pwm = Matrix(pwms[[1]]), subject = seqs[[2]], min.score = "80%", with.score = TRUE) # only + strand hits
matchPWM(pwm = Matrix(pwms[[1]]), subject = reverseComplement(seqs[[2]]), min.score = "80%", with.score = TRUE) # only - strand hits
as(searchSeq(x = pwms[1], subject = seqs[2], min.score = 0.98), "DataFrame")
findMotifHits(query = pwms[1],  subject = seqs[2], min.score = 8.0, method = "matchPWM")
findMotifHits(query = pwms3[1], subject = seqs[2], min.score = log(2^8.0), method = "homer2", homerfile = homerfile)
findMotifHits(query = pwms4[1], subject = seqs[2], min.score = log(2^8.0), method = "homer2", homerfile = homerfile)
reverseComplement(seqs[[2]][IRanges(247,254)]) # bug in homer2 parsing code in conveting - strand coordinates

# Selecting Transcription Factors Likely to Explain Changes in Chromatin Accessibility Using Stability Selection

Randomized Lasso stability selection proposed by Meinshausen and Bühlmann [@StabSel] applies the lasso regression on several subsamples of the data using a weakness parameter that adds additional variation to the lambda parameter and allows for more correlated variables to be selected together. The authors argue for this as a way of slightly overcomming the problem of lasso only selecting variables that are not correlated, and performing better in a noisy dataset depending on how strongly one sets the weakness parameter. Shah and Samworth [@compStabs] have further improved error control for stability selection using complementary pairs stability selection. The R `stabs` package [@stabs] implements the Shah and Samworth version of stability selection. `lisa` uses a modified version of the `stabsel` function in `stabs` that performs randomized lasso stability selection.

Here we demonstrate the use of randomized lasso stability selection to select transcription factors (TFs) that are likely to explain changes in chromatin accessibility from ATAC-seq data. One can also use stability selection on any other type of data like ChIP-seq of specific histone marks for example. We are given a vector of log-fold changes (logFC) in chromatin accessibility between two conditions that we consider to be our response vector. The predictor matrix will consist of the number of transcription factor bindng sites (TFBS) that each TF has across the peaks. The example data set comes from ENCODE [@encode] and consists of bam files for ATAC-seq from mouse postnatal (P0) liver (identifiers: ENCFF146ZCO, ENCFF109LQF) and lung (identifiers: ENCFF203DOC, ENCFF823PTD) tissues. Each condition had 2 replicates, and the peak calling was done per condition using MACS2 [@macs]. The peaks from both conditions were merged and used to calculate counts of the ATAC for all samples with QuasR [@QuasR]. Counts per million (CPM) were calculated per sample and averaged across replicates. The logFC was calculated as [log2(CPM(Liver)+8) - log2(CPM(Lung)+8)].

Only distal autosomal peaks were kept since promoter peaks tend not to change so much in accessibility, and we are interested in selecting TFs that likely explain logFC in enhancer regions. The `.rds` files used in lisa's example dataset consist of peaks that had an absolute logFC greater than 2 and leass than 2.2. This was done to reduce the number of peaks and speed up runtime to demonstrate the functions used in `lisa` that apply randomized lasso stability selection [@StabSel].



## Load Data


```{r load_data}

library(lisa)

# Path to extdata 
peaks_path <- system.file("extdata", "Liver_vs_Lung_ATAC_peaks.rds", package = "lisa", mustWork = TRUE)
response_path <- system.file("extdata", "Liver_vs_Lung_ATAC_logFC.rds", package = "lisa", mustWork = TRUE)

# Load response vector and peaks GRanges
response <- readRDS(response_path)
peaks <- readRDS(peaks_path)

```

## Get predictor matrix showing number of TFBS per motif across the peaks

The `findMotifHits` function can be used to get the binding site of each transcription factor across a given set of genomic regions, 
which in out case is the ATAC-seq peaks. The `get_numberOfTFBS_perSeqName` subsequently generates our predictor matrix which 
contains the number of TFBS each TF has across the given set of peaks. Note that peaks that have 0 TFBS with all TFs will be removed in the
resulting matrix.
Note that one can also make use of phylogenetic information of TFs and incorporate that in the predictor matrix. With ATAC-seq, we didn't want to restrict ourselves to conserved motif sequences.
One can add any additional property of the genomic regions in the response vector to compete against the TFs for selection. We added GC content ond observed over expected CpG (oeCpG) content.
\

```{r predictor}

library(JASPAR2018)
library(TFBSTools)
library("BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10")

# Genome
genome <- BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10

# Get PWMs
pwms <- getMatrixSet(JASPAR2018, list(matrixtype="PWM", tax_group="vertebrates"))

# Get TFBS on given GRanges
homerfile <- findHomer(homerfile = "homer2", dirs = "/work/gbioinfo/Appz/Homer/Homer-4.10.4/bin/")
hits <- findMotifHits(query = pwms, subject = peaks, min.score = 6.0, method = "homer2", homerfile = homerfile, genome = genome, Ncpu = 1)

# Get predictor matrix
predictor_matrix <- get_numberOfTFBS_perSeqName(TFBS_gr = hits, subject_gr = peaks, PWMs = pwms, Ncpu = 1)
predictor_matrix[1:6, 1:6]

# cacluctae GC and oeCpG content
peakSeq <- BSgenome::getSeq(genome, peaks)
fMono <- oligonucleotideFrequency(peakSeq, width=1, as.prob=TRUE)
fDi <- oligonucleotideFrequency(peakSeq, width=2, as.prob=TRUE)
percGC <- fMono[,"G"]+fMono[,"C"]
oeCpG <- (fDi[,"CG"] + 0.01) /(fMono[,"G"]*fMono[,"C"] + 0.01)

# add GC and oeCpG to predictor matrix
predictor_matrix <- cbind( percGC, predictor_matrix)
predictor_matrix <- cbind(oeCpG, predictor_matrix)
predictor_matrix[1:6, 1:6]


```


## Run randomized lasso stability selection

We can now run randomized lasso stability selection to select TFs that are likely to explain the log-fold changes in accessibility (response vector). We can appreciate that some selected TFs are correlated to each other and were chosen toegther to explain the observed changes in accessibility.
\


```{r run_stability}

# filter the remaining y
response <- response[names(response)%in%rownames(predictor_matrix)]

stabs <- randomized_stabsel(predictor_matrix, response, mc.cores = 1, cutoff = 0.7)

plot_stabilityPaths(stabs)

par(mfrow=c(1,1), mar=c(5,4,4,2)+3)

barplot_selectionProbability(stabs)

# plot correlation on TFBS matrix of selected TFs
sel_matrix <- predictor_matrix[, stabs$selected]
sel_cor <- cor(sel_matrix, method = "pearson")

ComplexHeatmap::Heatmap(matrix = sel_cor, name = "Pear. Cor.")
